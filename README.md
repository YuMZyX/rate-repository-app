# Rate repository app
Rate repository app created with React Native. 
Initial API for the application has been created by Kalle Ilves from Helsinki University and then forked and refactored by me for production readiness.
https://github.com/YuMZyX/rate-repository-api

Anonymous users have following features:
- A list of public GitHub repositories that have been reviewed in the app, including their avatar, fork count, code language, star count, review count, rating and description.
- Possibility to click/press any repository in the list to see their reviews and to see a button leading to the repository itself.
- Possibility to sign up and sign in

Signed in users can also:
- Create reviews for any public GitHub repositories including ones that are not yet listed in the application
- See a list of reviews created by yourself.
- Delete reviews created by yourself.
